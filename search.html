    "content": "[In the first part of 2016 \x26ndash; when I was traveling \x26ndash; I read a handful of books via Overdrive, but sometime in February my library card expired so that put a stop to that. But once I was back I got back in the habit, and I\x26rsquo;d meant to start writing posts about some of the books that I read, but that didn\x26rsquo;t happen, so I decided to write up this summary of what I read this year. (I was inspired to start writing about what I\x26rsquo;m reading by Derek Sivers\x26rsquo;s book notes, so the style of this may shamelessly resemble his style.) The List Musicophilia by Oliver Sacks (2007) Unfortunately, I\x26rsquo;d only had a passing knowledge of Oliver Sacks (from hearing him on Radiolab) before he died in 2015. When he died the first place I read about him at length was from my friend Abir\x26rsquo;s Facebook post, which I think was a link to a NYTimes piece, from where I jumped into The Atlantic\x26rsquo;s reading list. When I started traveling I decided to read his books, and the first one that I found available on Overdrive was Musicophilia, which is about music and the brain. Each chapter basically goes through a patient he\x26rsquo;d seen that has had neurological ailments related in some way to music or sound. I\x26rsquo;d heartily recommend it to anyone interested in music or \x26ldquo;pop neurology\x26rdquo;. (Open Library) Watchmen by Alan Moore (1986) I\x26rsquo;d read Watchmen once before (maybe 10 years ago), and I can\x26rsquo;t remember what spurred me on, but something reminded me of the book and made me want to read it again, so I did. The movie is good, but there\x26rsquo;s so much more depth in the novel. The snippets and documents between chapters completely make the whole book. It reminded me a bit of how immersed I used to feel in video games I played was I was younger (and sort of makes me want to go back and play some of them). If anybody has any recommendations for more good graphic novels, please let me know. (Open Library) I Am a Strange Loop by Douglas Hofstadter (2007) In 2007, Hofstadter put out I Am a Strange Loop as a modern update to \x26ndash; and more accessible version of \x26ndash; GEB. It\x26rsquo;s much clearer and easier to get through than GEB, but also loses something by sacrificing the depth and structure of GEB. Regardless, this is a great read that I\x26rsquo;d recommend. For anyone interested in linguistics I also really enjoy Hofstadter\x26rsquo;s lectures on YouTube about analogy and categories. (Open Library) The Dharma Bums by Jack Kerouac (1958) My friend Colin lent me this about a month ago, and I absolutely loved it. He said he thought I\x26rsquo;d like it since I\x26rsquo;d started doing some traveling and backpacking, and most all of Kerouac\x26rsquo;s writing revolves around traveling and life on the road in some sense. I loved it so much that I recommended it to my dad, who quickly bought and read On the Road, which I\x26rsquo;m waiting to borrow from him. (Open Library) The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien (1937) Somewhat shamefully, I\x26rsquo;d never read The Hobbit (and still haven\x26rsquo;t read Lord of the Rings) so when I was in Kuala Lumpur I read it. There\x26rsquo;s not much I can say that hasn\x26rsquo;t been said about the book, other than that I wish I would\x26rsquo;ve read it a lot sooner. (Open Library) The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat by Oliver Sacks (1985) Since I\x26rsquo;d loved Musicophilia so much earlier in the year, I\x26rsquo;d been wanting to read more Oliver Sacks, so when I inherited The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat I started reading it pretty quickly. Like Musicophilia, each chapter recounts a patient that Sacks had seen, around a variety of different subjects, the first being a man who mistakes his wife for a hat. The writing isn\x26rsquo;t quite as strong as musicophilia, but the stories are great regardless. (Open Library) The Gunslinger by Stephen King (1982) I stole a handful of my brother\x26rsquo;s books that were left in my parents\x26rsquo; basement, mostly Stephen King books. This one, which is the first book in The Dark Tower series, was the first one I\x26rsquo;ve read. I enjoyed it and I\x26rsquo;m going to keep reading the series, but it was a little slow. I\x26rsquo;m not quite sure what to make of it, but for whatever reason it left me really excited to read more in the series regardless. (Open Library) Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky (2003) I\x26rsquo;ve only started listening to and reading some of Chomsky\x26rsquo;s interviews and essays in the last couple years. Hegemony or Survival is the first book of his that I\x26rsquo;ve read. From Wikipedia: Chomsky\x26rsquo;s main argument in Hegemony or Survival is that the socio-economic elite who control the United States have pursued an \x26ldquo;Imperial Grand Strategy\x26rdquo; since the end of World War II in order to maintain global hegemony through military, political and economic means. He argues that in doing so they have repeatedly shown a total disregard for democracy and human rights, in stark contrast to the US government\x26rsquo;s professed support for those values. Furthermore, he argues that this continual pursuit of global hegemony now threatens the existence of the human species itself because of the increasing proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Drawing historical examples from 1945 through to 2003 to support his argument, Chomsky looks at the US government\x26rsquo;s support for regimes responsible for mass human rights abuses (including ethnic cleansing and genocide), namely El Salvador, Colombia, Turkey, Israel, Egypt, South Africa and Indonesia. He also discusses US support for militant dissident groups widely considered \x26ldquo;terrorists\x26rdquo;, particularly in Nicaragua and Cuba, as well as direct military interventions, such as the Vietnam War, NATO bombing of Yugoslavia, Afghan War and Iraq War, in order to further its power and grasp of resources. In doing so, he highlights that US foreign policy – whether controlled by Republican or Democratic administrations – still follows the same agenda of gaining access to lucrative resources and maintaining US world dominance. It\x26rsquo;s a dense book, and I\x26rsquo;m still digesting it, but it\x26rsquo;s mostly a more in-depth version of what you\x26rsquo;d expect from a Chomsky interview. I think if I re-read it at some point I\x26rsquo;ll probably find a lot more that I didn\x26rsquo;t absorb on first read. (Open Library) Casting Fortune by John M. Ford (1989) Probably about 15 years ago, my great grandma was moving out of her house, and we were free to take whatever we wanted from the house, so I took a fantasy story anthology. The first story was Green is the Color by John M. Ford. I only ever ended up reading a handful of the stories in the book, but Green is the Color became one of my favorite fantasy stories. It took me a long time, but a couple years ago I finally got around to ordering some more John M. Ford books, and this year I finally read this one. (And it only somewhat counts because Casting Fortune is made up of 3 short stories, one of which is Green is the Color. I really just wanted an excuse to re-read it.) A couple years ago I found out that Ford lived in Minnesota, but died in 2006. All of the stories in Casting Fortune take place in a shared (between authors) fantasy world called Liavek. I haven\x26rsquo;t read any stories other than Ford\x26rsquo;s, but the setting is my favorite part of the stories. I would definitely recommend for fans of short fantasy stories.(Open Library) 1Q84 by Haruki Murakami (2009-2010) I can\x26rsquo;t remember where I first heard of Haruki Murakami, but everything I heard about him seemed to indicate that I should read his stuff. It was worth it; I think 1Q84 is my favorite book I read this year. The plot is really complex and weird, revolving around a cult, two parallel realities, and lots more (it\x26rsquo;s tough to mention much without giving a lot away). I thought the ending was a little disappointing but overall I loved it. I\x26rsquo;d definitely like to read more Murakami in 2017. If anyone has recommendations for his other books (or similar stories from other authors), I\x26rsquo;d love to hear them! (Open Library) The first half of American Gods by Neil Gaiman (2001) I\x26rsquo;d wanted to read Neil Gaiman for a long time, and American Gods was one option available in Overdrive was I was traveling. Unfortunately, I only got about halfway through it when my library card expired. But I loved what I\x26rsquo;d read so far, so I\x26rsquo;m planning on starting again at some point, and I\x26rsquo;d also really like to read other Gaiman. (Open Library) The first half of Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality by Eliezer Yudkowsky (2010-2015) I read some of HPMOR, and enjoyed it a lot, but didn\x26rsquo;t finish it for some reason. I\x26rsquo;m planning on coming back to it at some point. It\x26rsquo;s a fanfiction of Harry Potter where his aunt marries a scientist, and Harry is raised in a happy and loving household. He goes to Hogwarts and tries to understand magic using the scientific method. (Website) What If? by Randall Munroe (2014) I spent most of my New Year\x26rsquo;s weekend watching the Downton Alley marathon on TPT 2 (interspersed with a couple Sherlock episodes), and broke it up by reading What If?. I\x26rsquo;d bought the book when it came out in 2014, read a couple chapters, stuck it in my bathroom for toilet reading, and never read another page. So I started it again on New Year\x26rsquo;s Eve and was able to get through it in a day. (If you haven\x26rsquo;t heard of What If?, check out the blog. The premise is pretty thoroughly covered by the subtitle: \x26ldquo;Serious Scientific Answers to Absurd Hypothetical Questions\x26rdquo;.) Suffice it to say, this book is awesome \x26ndash; and a quick read \x26ndash; and if I was tasked with getting anybody more interested in science, I\x26rsquo;d give them this book. Check out the table of contents if you\x26rsquo;re intrigued. (Open Library) What I want to read in 2017 Right now I\x26rsquo;m reading The Best American Short Stories of 2013, which my grandma lent me. Over Christmas my uncle lent me a book about Emil Zátopek, a Czech distance runner. I also got the second Dark Tower book, The Drawing of the Three, for Christmas. My friend Keith recently lent me the Lonely Planet guide to Peru. There are a few other books I recently inherited: Consciousness Explained by Daniel Dennett, Society of Mind by Marvin Minsky, and A World of Ideas by Bill Moyers. I recently picked up the Unix-themed Humble Book Bundle of ebooks. There are some writers that I\x26rsquo;ve never delved into that I\x26rsquo;d like to: Camus, Dostoyevsky, Gwen Ifill, and Neal Stephenson, to name a few. I\x26rsquo;ve been lucky to have been gifted and lent a lot of really great books lately; if anybody has any recommendations, I\x26rsquo;d love to hear them!]",

    "content": "[Waiting\x26hellip; For the last 3 or so years, I\x26rsquo;ve been passively searching for a really good keyboard, since I spend a lot of time typing. Mainly my wants were for it to be ergonomic (split) and to have mechanical keyswitches. After my brother semi-recently started having major RSI issues, my search has been kicked into high gear. Herein I\x26rsquo;ll attempt to document some thoughts on the keyboards I considered. Keyboardio The first keyboard that really caught my attention was Keyboardio, mainly because of the really great blog post from Jesse Vincent\x26ndash;one of the two founders\x26ndash;describing the different iterations he went through while initially designing it. It was funded as a Kickstarter project\x26ndash;and easily met it\x26rsquo;s goal\x26ndash;but unfortunately has been stuck in design and manufacturing stages for a long time, and is still in pre-order status, expected to be delivered in Q1 2017. Fortunately the team has been really open about the entire process, and has written extensively about it, including the various decisions that have gone into design, and hurdles they\x26rsquo;ve had to jump in working with hardware manufacturers. It\x26rsquo;s been a super fascinating process to follow. The main reason I didn\x26rsquo;t buy one was because of the price, $329 (was $250 for Kickstarter backers if I recall correctly), which is more than I\x26rsquo;d like to pay. Ergodox The next keyboard I seriously considered was the Ergodox. The design of the Ergodox is really cool (and freely licensed!), but it takes a little more than \x26ldquo;here\x26rsquo;s some money\x26rdquo; to procure one. They generally have to be bought as a kit, and you have to buy the kit as part of a \x26ldquo;drop\x26rdquo; (a group manufacturing deal). Then, you\x26rsquo;ll have to do some soldering and flash the firmware onto the keyboard. This leaves a lot of room for customization (and people have made some seriously cool designs), and deserves a lot of credit for the DIY ethos, but it was more work than I wanted to sign up for. Then along came the Ergodox EZ, a pre-assembled Ergodox. I would\x26rsquo;ve leapt at this, but the price was just a little higher than I wanted to pay, because when it first became available for IndieGogo pre-order (it\x26rsquo;s now available for regular purchase) I wasn\x26rsquo;t employed. Kinesis Advantage I haven\x26rsquo;t really seriously considered the Kinesis Advantage because of the price (are you noticing a trend?), but it\x26rsquo;s a cool keyboard that I read about pretty extensively anyway. Kinesis has been making ergonomic keyboards with mechanical keys for longer than anyone else as far as I\x26rsquo;m aware. Anandtech has a really good review of the Advantage. Ultimate Hacking Keyboard The Ultimate Hacking Keyboard is another crowdfunded one that\x26rsquo;s still in the pre-order process (on CrowdSupply, expected to ship in February). I really like the form factor of the UHK, but again, the price (currently $220, will be $250 after launch) kept me from ordering, although on this one I was pretty close. IBM Model M I recently inherited an IBM Model M. I\x26rsquo;d never used one, but I knew that they were pretty sought after for their clicky keys. (Can confirm; extremely clicky.) I\x26rsquo;m not using it (it\x26rsquo;s a little too clicky, it\x26rsquo;s not split, and my laptop doesn\x26rsquo;t have a PS\/2 port), but it\x26rsquo;s neat to have. Microsoft 4000 At work I recently found an old Microsoft Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000 in the closet, and started using it. It\x26rsquo;s fairly comfortable, but to my surprise, it actually takes more force to push down the keys than the mechanical keyboards I\x26rsquo;ve used. (This might not be the case with newer models, I\x26rsquo;m guessing the one I\x26rsquo;m using is at least 4 or 5 years old.) I\x26rsquo;ve also come to dislike the numpad (on any keyboard, not specifically on this one), since you have to reach further for the mouse. Mistel Barocco review The keyboard I eventually went with\x26ndash;back in October\x26ndash;was the Mistel Barocco with Cherry MX Brown switches from Amazon. The form factor is pretty similar to the Ultimate Hacking Keyboard and the Ergodox, but the price is $160, which I could stomach. It\x26rsquo;s been awesome so far. I was a little hesitant at first, because it just came out in August, and there were only a couple reviews when I bought it (still only 9 at the time of this writing), but the ones that were there were pretty thorough and enthusiastic about it. My only gripes with it are that\x26ndash;though the two halves fit together\x26ndash;there\x26rsquo;s no mechanism for keeping them together, which would\x26rsquo;ve been useful for transporting; and also that the keys aren\x26rsquo;t backlit (although there are now backlit models available for $180). (I\x26rsquo;ve also had issues with the left half of the keyboard not being immediately recognized after waking my laptop, but I\x26rsquo;m fairly certain this is either being caused by my OS or the USB hub the keyboard is plugged into, or some combination thereof.) But these are minor gripes. Overall the keyboard has been awesome to use. It\x26rsquo;s both the first ergonomic keyboard and the first mechanical keyboard that I\x26rsquo;ve used full time, and it\x26rsquo;s been extremely comfortable and easy to get used to. Although I\x26rsquo;d still like to try a few of the others that I mentioned (esp. Keyboardio and Ergodox), I\x26rsquo;ve been really pleased with the Barocco, even before considering prices. I\x26rsquo;d highly recommend it to anyone who spends a lot of time typing. To Colemak\x26hellip; Another thing (besides mechanical keyswitches and a split design) that I often see mentioned in online discussions about keyboards is key layout. The argument against QWERTY usually goes that it was designed in the 19th century, and meant for typewriters, and so was designed with a set of goals and restrictions that no longer exist or don\x26rsquo;t apply today (i.e. that letters often appearing in subsequent order shouldn\x26rsquo;t be next to each other to prevent jamming, and that the keys in \x26ldquo;typewriter\x26rdquo; should be located entirely in the top row for demonstration purposes[1]). So QWERTY is what was designed, and it\x26rsquo;s what we still have today because it\x26rsquo;s impractical to switch since QWERTY is what everyone has learned and gotten used to. But that hasn\x26rsquo;t stopped individuals from coming up with new layouts and switching themselves. And people who switch often report major increases in comfort, and sometimes minor increases in typing speed. In the \x26lsquo;30s we got Dvorak, still the second most popular layout after QWERTY. In the 2000s, there have been a lot of new layouts, often designed partially or entirely by computer algorithm to optimize for things like commonly adjacent letters being placed on opposite halves, and the most common letters being on the home row. Colemak and Workman are the most popular of the more recent layouts. In November I switched to Colemak since it\x26rsquo;s a pretty popular layout[2] (third, after QWERTY and Dvorak) so there are a lot of anecdotes and guides available from people who switched (I was especially worried about having to move things around in Vim). The first couple weeks proved to be really difficult. ~15 years of touch typing with QWERTY is not easily unlearned. I practiced a lot with zty.pe, a typing game my friend Zach had shown me, and that helped a lot. After 4 weeks I was fairly comfortable with it, and had gotten close to my speed with QWERTY. But even by only a couple weeks in, I noticed a huge increase in comfort. Luckily I\x26rsquo;ve never dealt with too much wrist pain, but at the end of some days where I\x26rsquo;ve spent a lot of time typing, I\x26rsquo;ve had some aches. I haven\x26rsquo;t noticed this at all since switching to Colemak. \x26hellip; and back again Alas, all good things must come to an end. I got a job that entails working on other people\x26rsquo;s workstations much of the time, which means I have to stick with QWERTY for the time being. Part of me is considering trying to stay proficient in both layouts, but I\x26rsquo;m not sure it would be worth the trouble[3]. It took me about 2 days before I was back to my normal speed and comfort level with QWERTY. (I used zty.pe again to make the switch back.) Notes The Colemak website has a more extensive list of complaints about QWERTY and Dvorak. \x26crarr; Colemak (along with Dvorak) was also an option built-in to my new Barocco keyboard, although I found it easier to just use my OS\x26rsquo;s built-in keyboard layout options. \x26crarr; Though I\x26rsquo;d be interested in in hearing from anyone who regularly moves between different layouts. \x26crarr;]",
    "summary": "Waiting\x26hellip; For the last 3 or so years, I\x26rsquo;ve been passively searching for a really good keyboard, since I spend a lot of time typing. Mainly my wants were for it to be ergonomic (split) and to have mechanical keyswitches. After my brother semi-recently started having major RSI issues, my search has been kicked into high gear. Herein I\x26rsquo;ll attempt to document some thoughts on the keyboards I considered. Keyboardio The first keyboard that really caught my attention was Keyboardio, mainly because of the really great blog post from Jesse Vincent\x26ndash;one of the two founders\x26ndash;describing the different iterations he went through while initially designing it."

    "content": "[It\x26rsquo;s now been a little over a year since I left my job to travel last November, and somehow I\x26rsquo;ve survived. The hardest part has been the awkward confusion when someone asks what I do. I usually sort of stumble through a brief explanation that I\x26rsquo;m taking time off to study or somesuch. Most respond with an incredulous look seeming to say either \x26ldquo;I don\x26rsquo;t believe you\x26rdquo; or \x26ldquo;this asshole definitely lives in his parents\x26rsquo; basement.\x26rdquo; Mental health By far the biggest beneficiary of my year off has been my mental health. I can\x26rsquo;t even begin to enunciate what a difference it makes to wake up everyday without an alarm, feeling totally refreshed and getting up to work on and learn about things that I care about. There\x26rsquo;ve been (many) bouts of laziness, but I can confidently say I\x26rsquo;ve learned more in the past year than in any other. I learned how to bake bread a couple weeks ago. Besides generally feeling more relaxed, I eat better and cook better, I read a lot more, I make some of my own household products, I\x26rsquo;ve set up a compost bin for my apartment building, I write more, I go to neighborhood council meetings, I spend more time hanging out with parrots, and on and on. Of course these are all things I could have done when I worked full time, but in reality there\x26rsquo;s no way I would have had the time and motivation. After spending 9 hours a day in an office \x26ndash; and perhaps an extra 1-2 hours idly thinking about work \x26ndash; I didn\x26rsquo;t have enough motivation during the week to do much of anything other than collapse on the couch and stare at the TV. (I should note that my old job was mostly very laid back, and overall really enjoyable \x26ndash; mostly thanks to my great co-workers. I think the key takeaway for me was that I was stuck spending 40 hours every week doing work that was ultimately not very meaningful to me.) Back to work Of course the sabbatical could only last so long. Over the summer when I first moved back to St. Paul, I sent out a lot of applications, and had a handful of interviews, but never got an offer. It was pretty discouraging[1]. But then a little over a week ago, I got an email from a small Minneapolis company I\x26rsquo;d applied to in May and hadn\x26rsquo;t heard back from, asking if I\x26rsquo;d come in for an interview. I had the interview earlier this week on Monday, accepted their offer the same day, and started on Wednesday. It was a surprise; I\x26rsquo;d all but given up looking for a job over the summer, and had made other plans for the coming year[2]. So now I\x26rsquo;m an IT manager. (I\x26rsquo;m also the only IT person, so it\x26rsquo;s not as impressive as I wish it were.) I remember being excited when I first applied for this job back in May because it\x26rsquo;s a part time position, but I\x26rsquo;m making about the same per-hour amount as I made in my old job, which will be plenty enough to sustain myself on, and \x26ndash; more importantly \x26ndash; will leave me with plenty of free time to keep doing the things I really care about, which should help me avoid the burnout I had at my old job. I only had two days to work with the person previously in my new position[3], but it\x26rsquo;s been enjoyable so far. In my cover letter back in May I had said that I was looking to work for a small business or nonprofit; JMA is a small business that works almost entirely with local nonprofits so I\x26rsquo;m in a great environment with a lot of really smart, kind people. Spending According to Personal Capital, my total spending from November 2015 to November 2016 was $10,175, meaning I spent an average of about $848 per month. From November to May \x26ndash; while traveling \x26ndash; I spent a total of $4541, or about $757 per month. From May to this November, I spent $5641, or about $940 per month. Now that the Cross Country season is over[4], I\x26rsquo;m planning on getting rid of my car, which should save me an extra chunk. When I stopped working last year my biggest worry was that what I had saved up wasn\x26rsquo;t going to get me as far as I thought it would. That was completely unfounded. I\x26rsquo;ve had a downright comfy and fulfilling year. Happiness for sale Reflecting on the last year, it\x26rsquo;s hard to get passed the feeling that money has bought me a lot of happiness, which is a discomforting thing to think about. Or \x26ndash; more accurately \x26ndash; money has bought me a degree of independence I\x26rsquo;ve never had, and that independence has allowed me the time and energy to spend on things that have made me more content[5] than I\x26rsquo;ve been at any other point. It sounds nice to say that, beyond a baseline of basic necessities, money can\x26rsquo;t buy happiness, but it just doesn\x26rsquo;t seem true to me. Having \x26ldquo;fuck you\x26rdquo; money seems to me to bring the opportunity for happiness on some level (not as a literal fuck-you to anybody, but as a measure of dependence on work). This is a troubling notion, and hammers home for me just how privileged and lucky I\x26rsquo;ve been. Notes I was especially discouraged about one particular instance, where I\x27d gotten to the third round only to get turned down :( It was at a really cool software company in New York (it was a remote position). They offered tuition reimbursement, whatever hardware I wanted, conference funds, and all kinds of cool stuff. Not to mention I would\x27ve been working with a ton of really smart people. (I\x27m not bitter...) \x26crarr; More traveling. \x26crarr; ... who I\x27m really jealous of. He\x27s about to go visit family in Guam. Safe travels, Trevor! \x26crarr; I don\x27t mean to show off (yes I do), but I just found out today I was voted our CC section\x27s assistant coach of the year. It\x27s already going to my head. \x26crarr; I guess I would have a hard time justifying the claim that I\x27m happier in general than at any other point in my life, but I feel comfortable saying that I\x27m more content. \x26crarr;]",

    "content": "[My phone has been bumming me out lately. I\x26rsquo;ve decided to fantasize about my ideal mobile computer, a rough description of which is as follows. The Dragonbox Pyra comes pretty close to everything I want. The original Dragonbox device, the Pandora, was released in 2008 and still receives OS updates, and you can still buy any replacement parts needed. Screen I\x26rsquo;m ready to be done with back-lit, full-color, battery-busting displays. My ideal computer would have a 5\x26rdquo;-6\x26rdquo; front-lit e-ink display, ideally in color. Color e-ink has suffered through various fits and starts over the last 5 or so years, most recently being announced by E Ink (the company) for digital signage at the SID Display Week exhibition in May. There are some obvious use-cases that e-ink isn\x26rsquo;t well-suited for (watching videos, playing fast-paced games), but the things that e-ink is good for (reading and writing text) is exactly what I want my computer to encourage me to do more of. (Besides, Sonic the Hedgehog running on a Nook Simple Touch from 2011 has me not too worried about actual refresh rate when I want to watch a video or something.) CPU and Antennas There are some cool mini-computers that use a Raspberry Pi, and that was where my intuition took me first. But for my main computer, I\x26rsquo;d like something a little bit more powerful and flexible. Although it\x26rsquo;s not finished yet, the lowRISC system-on-a-chip seems to be just about the perfect candidate. The Blackberry Priv, Blackberry\x27s first phone not running BBOS. The keyboard doubles as a trackpad for swiping and moving the cursor in text areas, as with other recent Blackberry phones. The lack of removable battery is the main thing that kept me from getting it. For antennas, my computer would only have WiFi, GPS, and accelerometer onboard. There would also be a separate USB module (or a couple) for FM radio, bluetooth, NFC, SIM card, and cellular antennas. (A camera and microphone would also be in a separate USB module.) I prefer to keep it lean with only the necessities. Ports All the ports! I want to be able to hook up an external keyboard, mouse, and display to put together whatever workspace I want as a \x26ldquo;dumb terminal\x26rdquo; that plugs into my computer. Microsoft and Canonical have notably been pushing in this direction recently (with Windows 10 and Unity 8, respectively), and the Dragonbox devices are perfectly suited to it. Luckily, we don\x26rsquo;t need any new technology to pull it off, we just need to revert the trend of fewer and fewer ports on computers. This sort of setup obviously can\x26rsquo;t cater to everybody (AAA gamers, people compiling big codebases, people using CAD), but I think it could be a big step when we can realistically only own one computer and connect it to various workspace configurations, rather than having some combination of smartphone, tablet, laptop, desktop, work computer, smart TV, and game console\x26ndash;all with their own CPUs. Movement in this direction would make different computing environments cheaper and more accessible (for people who now can only afford a smartphone, for example). The Fairphone 2 is the only smartphone to ever receive a 10\/10 repairability score from iFixit. Fairphone (a Dutch company) is also the only smartphone producer that I\x27m aware of that uses only conflict-free materials in its phones. Specifically, I\x26rsquo;d like to have a couple USB-B slots (either USB 2 or 3), one or two USB-C slots, ethernet, HDMI (either micro or full-size), and a 3.5mm headset port. Modularity Upgradeability, durability, and repairability are of the utmost importance for my computer. It should take heed from computers like older ThinkPads, the Fairphone 2, and the DragonBox Pyra. It should encourage the replacement of the battery (which should be giant, by the way), and make accessible each of the other boards, sealed only by Phillips screws. This thing should be built to last on the scale of one to two decades (or more). Keyboard Although software keyboards have made significant gains in the last few years (mostly by getting creative with swiping), they\x26rsquo;re still woefully inferior to hardware keyboards. The effect this has on defining the purpose of a device is massive; getting any kind of productive work done with a software keyboard is left only to a dedicated few. For most intents and purposes, it just won\x26rsquo;t cut it. This leaves keyboardless smartphones and tablets fully in the realm of devices made for consumption. The Amazon Kindle DX, from 2009, with a giant 10 inch e-ink display ticks a few of my boxes, but is no longer available new. Although I\x26rsquo;d like to have some room for consumption (long texts, blog posts, music, and podcasts come to mind), I want my computer to cater to creativity and productivity. The current market for devices that fill this niche is underwhelming, to say the least. On my computer, the keyboard would sit under the portrait-situated screen (i.e. not a slider). It would have the full set of keys from full-sized keyboards, and would include the ability to swipe across the keyboard to move the cursor (shamelessly stolen from recent Blackberry keyboards). Software The duopoly in mobile operating systems has left us with gimped computers that are meant to favor app stores over the open web (and\x26ndash;to beat a dead horse\x26ndash;to encourage consumption). My computer would start with coreboot or libreboot, and allow the user to use whichever OS they\x26rsquo;d prefer. By default, it\x26rsquo;d perhaps come with either Debian or rooted Android (probably of the Copperhead OS variety) for ease of use. Regardless, allowing the user to have full control over the software is paramount. The monoculture of smartphone and tablet design is disappointing. The dominance of iOS and Android\x26ndash;to the exclusion of most other competitors like Blackberry, Windows, Mozilla, Jolla\x26ndash;does no one any favors (well, no end users at least). At least among my peers in my generation, it would seem very strange to most if someone didn\x26rsquo;t have either an Android or iOS phone, let alone if someone didn\x26rsquo;t carry a smartphone at all. My main beef with this situation is that almost all of these phones are unabashedly computers meant for consumption and convenience over all else. Whereas computers with hardware keyboards and many ports and bigger screens are as effective of tools for creativity as they are for consumption, our modern slabs mostly hinder any chances for creativity (or, at least, they offer no where near the capacity for productivity that the aforementioned computers do). What I was really thinking about when describing my ideal mobile computer is how I could combine all of the benefits of laptops, e-readers, and smartphones into one. I want to have as much power as I do on my laptop with the portability of my smartphone. On the web, we\x26rsquo;ve seen a long and gradual shift toward the centralization of content and services at the server level (AWS) and the service level (Facebook, Google, etc.), instead of the spreading out of power. ISPs have increasingly exerted more control and made it impractical to run any type of server at home (the suggestion itself sounds almost absurd) by reducing upload times to near zero, and blocking ports needed to run home servers. To me, this gradual centralization of web services and inability to run servers from home seems parallel and analogous to the gradual shift toward computers that are useful only for consumption. In one sense, it\x26rsquo;s wonderful that cheap smartphones have enabled so many to access the web. I should note that I wouldn\x26rsquo;t suggest that all consumption is necessarily a bad thing. For example, access to information via Wikipedia, books via Project Gutenberg, classes via Khan Academy, repair tutorials via iFixit, and countless other sources can all be wonderful modes of consumption. But, it seems like as our devices cater more and more toward consumption and reliance on centralized services (rather than productivity and independence), the feedback loop that centralizes services will only be added to, empowering manufacturers and service providers at the expense of users.]",

In my last week in Thailand, my laptop started refusing to boot up (FAN ERROR.), and a tiny crack appeared on my phone screen and gradually turned into a big crack, rendering it unable to pick up most touches and swipes. Evidently the computing gods were angry that I was leaving the Land of Australian Expats, but I figured I\x26rsquo;d give a shot at fixing them since they\x26rsquo;re both only a couple years old. I\x26rsquo;m not sure what caused either of the problems. The laptop (a 2013 ThinkPad X1 Carbon) would display the ThinkPad splash screen, then give a beep inform me that there was a FAN ERROR. I couldn\x26rsquo;t get into BIOS. After a big of googling, it was pretty apparent that I\x26rsquo;m not the first to run into this issue. Seems that it\x26rsquo;s a normal thing among various 2008-2014 X and T series (at least) ThinkPads. Unfortunately the usual advice seemed to be either replace the fan or blow on the fan exhaust port to trick it into booting up, after which you\x26rsquo;d have to monitor the system temperature (\x26hellip;). I tried the blowing thing and couldn\x26rsquo;t get it to work. I\x26rsquo;d somewhat regretted getting an ultrabook for a while since it\x26rsquo;s just short of impossible to replace most parts, and I was again cursing my judgment since I figured it\x26rsquo;d be a mess if I tried to get the fan out of there. But I decided to open it up and take a look. There were 7 Phillips head screws holding the case together, and you have to pull the keyboard side up, which threw me off for a minute. The fan is the circular thing underneath the copper-colored thing. I manually spun the fan around a couple times and noticed that at a certain point in the rotation it seemed to get stuck on something. There was no way to look at what it was without removing the fan glue, but I manually spun it around a few more times, and blew compressed air around the whole board, which seemed to dislodge whatever the fan was stuck on. After this the computer magically booted up again. Hopefully this will be helpful to a future googler who\x26rsquo;s about to smash their ThinkPad over their head. Replacing the screen on my phone (an LG G3) promises to be a bit more work. Luckily iFixit has an awesome guide for exactly this. I just need to get around to ordering the parts and tools.]",

Chapter 6 was on a phenomenon called \x26ldquo;musical hallucinations.\x26rdquo; In contrast with musical imagery, where a person imagines the sound of music in her head, musical hallucinations entail truly feeling like you\x26rsquo;re hearing music. According to the book, brain scans show that people experiencing musical hallucinations show the same brain activity activity as those actually listening to music. Some who suffer from musical hallucinations are entirely unable to rid themselves of constant and uncontrollable music, to the point that their lives can be overwhelmed by it. I\x26rsquo;ve never experienced this, but reading it did remind me of an experience I had during the winter of 2010-\x26lsquo;11, where I hallucinated a smell. I was in the last couple miles of a 16 mile run with my cross country team on a cold winter morning. We were running by a community center off Marshall Avenue in St. Paul, and I smelled the strongest scent of bubble gum I\x26rsquo;d ever smelled. It was quite pleasant. But my mouth was seemingly frozen solid so I didn\x26rsquo;t mention it until we finished the run and I had a chance to unthaw. To my surprise, nobody else had noticed the scent. The top Google image result for \x22phantosmia.\x22 I had all but forgotten about this experience until I read Musicophilia. I decided to dig in to see what the web had to say about hallucinating smells. Apparently it\x26rsquo;s called \x26ldquo;Phantosmia\x26rdquo;, and usually it\x26rsquo;s an unpleasant smell, according to the UK\x26rsquo;s NHS. Wikipedia assures me that phantosmia \x26ldquo;often occurs with neurological and psychological disorders such as schizophrenia, mood disorders, Parkinsons disease, epilepsy, neuroblastoma, and frequent migranes,\x26rdquo; so I\x26rsquo;ve got nothing to worry about. Mayoclinic.org also paints a bright picture: \x26ldquo;Phantosmia may occur after a head injury or upper respiratory infection. It can also be caused by temporal lobe seizures, inflamed sinuses, brain tumors and Parkinson\x26rsquo;s disease.\x26rdquo; I don\x26rsquo;t recall suffering any brain injuries (then again, who remembers suffering a brain injury?), so I\x26rsquo;m going to chalk it up to being toward the tail end of an endurance workout and being affected by the cold temperature. Regardless, I\x26rsquo;ll be on the lookout for further signs of temporal lobe seizures and brain tumors. I had forgotten about the hallucination until I read the book; I think this is a pretty good argument for not reading anymore, lest I uncover further signs of brain damage hidden from my memory. What\x26rsquo;s new It\x26rsquo;s 3:44am and I\x26rsquo;m writing this post in an airport cafeteria waiting for a restaurant called Toast Box to open at 4. In a couple hours I\x26rsquo;m flying from Kuala Lumpur to Chiang Mai, Thailand. For my last month or so in KL, I didn\x26rsquo;t do a whole lot. Lots of relaxing and slowly lounging around town. I started working on software to make building websites easier with two close friends and former co-workers. (That\x26rsquo;s here.) KL has been great, but saying I\x26rsquo;m excited to get out would be an understatement. I\x26rsquo;m ready for something a bit smaller, and I\x26rsquo;m ready for a hotel room with windows.]",
    "summary": "I recently read Musicophilia: Tales of Music and the Brain by Oliver Sacks. Chapter 6 was on a phenomenon called \x26ldquo;musical hallucinations.\x26rdquo; In contrast with musical imagery, where a person imagines the sound of music in her head, musical hallucinations entail truly feeling like you\x26rsquo;re hearing music. According to the book, brain scans show that people experiencing musical hallucinations show the same brain activity activity as those actually listening to music."

    "content": "[Reference and soundtrack for this post. I\x26rsquo;ve been in Kuala Lumpur for just over a month now. As I alluded to in my last post, lately I\x26rsquo;ve been taking the free KL city bus around almost everyday, and seeing more of the city. I\x26rsquo;ve been to Petronas Twin Towers, Menara Kuala Lumpur, back to Lake Gardens, and a bunch of malls like Low Yat (an \x26ldquo;IT lifestyle mall\x26rdquo;), KLCC, and Berjaya Times Square. Most of these are in the Golden Triangle and Bukit Bintang areas, a couple miles east of my hostel. Petronas Twin Towers Last week I went to the US Embassy to get some extra passport pages, which is a service that is apparently ceasing after January 1st. It felt like a DMV. I\x26rsquo;ve been catching up on podcasts that I fell behind on, mostly while walking around the malls and riding the bus. I also saw the new James Bond movie the other day, and I\x26rsquo;ll probably see Star Wars soon, like the obedient consumer that I am. OH! and I just found out there\x26rsquo;s a new Charlie Kaufman movie called Anomalisa that opens next month. I\x26rsquo;m not sure if I\x26rsquo;ll be able to see it in Malaysia but I\x26rsquo;ll be keeping an eye out. Relaxing at Lake Gardens. Christmas in Malaysia—it turns out—is serious business. Everywhere I turn, including in my hostel lounge, there are brightly adorned Christmas trees and smiling Santas and plastic snowmen. Especially in the Golden Triangle (aka the Central Business District), it feels very much like the wonderfully commercial sales-month that I\x26rsquo;m used to in the US. (There\x26rsquo;s nothing like a good deal on TVs to make me feel all warm and fuzzy.) This despite the fact that only 9.2% of Malaysians are Christian. It is a public holiday here, but apparently it\x26rsquo;s only celebrated on Christmas Eve, and then it\x26rsquo;s business-as-usual on the 25th. A giant Christmas tree outside KLCC. You can see the full photo album of things from the last month here. Resolutions New Year\x26rsquo;s resolutions are silly. Here are mine. Write I want to get better at writing. About techy stuff, thinky stuff, and bloggy stuff. At the moment I have 7 half-written blog posts in my drafts folder about tech\/web\/software, so part one of my resolution is to commit to finishing these posts and writing more in general. Also related to writing better, I need to: Read Not that reading isn\x26rsquo;t an end unto itself, but I want to read both for the sake of reading and of writing better. I\x26rsquo;ve already been reading a lot more since arriving in Kuala Lumpur so part two of my resolution is to keep it up, and maybe even kick it up a gear. Meditate I\x26rsquo;ve tried to start meditating more times than I can count, and I never stick with it. Part three of my resolution is to stick with it. I want to think more clearly, stay more focused, and be more relaxed. I\x26rsquo;m hoping meditation can be a step in that direction. There\x26rsquo;s inevitably a lot more that I\x26rsquo;m not including, but I think focusing on these three things will help me with all the other ones. Like all good New Year\x26rsquo;s resolutions, it inevitably contains too much anyway, and is sure to collapse unto itself. Maybe I should just get a gym membership. ¯\\_(ツ)_\/¯ Happy Festivus!]",

    "content": "[I\x26rsquo;ve been in Kuala Lumpur for just under two weeks now, and I\x26rsquo;m settling into a pretty comfortable routine. I usually divide my day into three parts: in one part I explore a new part of the city, in another I head to the library to code or read, and in the last I relax. In between I find some food. I switch up the arrangement of the parts each day. Just having a routine is nice, though, and it\x26rsquo;s helping me adjust pretty well. In no particular order, here are some thoughts on adapting to various aspects of life in Malaysia. Language Getting down the basics of Bahasa Malay has been straightforward. Word order is subject-verb-object like English. It also borrows a lot of words from English (this is where Malay branches apart from Indonesian, which is closely related but borrows from Dutch). The writing system is very phonetic, which is almost jarring coming from English. Most words are pronounced exactly how you\x26rsquo;d guess when reading them. The only problem is that almost everyone here speaks English (and I\x26rsquo;m so white), so everyone defaults to English. That\x26rsquo;s probably a good thing though, because I\x26rsquo;d be lost beyond the basics. My aunt was right, though, when she said that most people would probably be thankful when I put a small effort into using Malay. Usually I just slip in a terima kasih or selamat pagi. Food It can\x26rsquo;t be overstated how good the food is. And the food stalls and cafés are neverending! Just walking down random streets, I\x26rsquo;ll often unintentionally wander into big street markets lined with the most wonderful-smelling food I could imagine. I\x26rsquo;m glad I have another couple months in KL, because I\x26rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface yet. Getting around So far, I\x26rsquo;ve used the train to get from the airport to the city center, and to get to Batu Caves (more on that below). Other than that, I\x26rsquo;ve just walked everywhere. Getting around on foot is pretty easy, but there are some areas where sidewalks are a little weird. Sometimes they\x26rsquo;ll just end, or they\x26rsquo;ll merge into the road. For awhile I would get confused and not know how to keep going in the general direction I was trying to go, until I realized that people would just walk on the road. This happens even on bigger roads where traffic is flying by, so it took me a bit to get used to, but now I\x26rsquo;m on board. It\x26rsquo;s evened out by the fact that drivers often park partially on the sidewalk, and motorcyclists (who are numerous!) often drive on the sidewalks. I\x26rsquo;ve explored just about everywhere within a three kilometer radius of my hostel, so over the next couple weeks I\x26rsquo;m going to start using the Go-KL city bus (because it\x26rsquo;s free!) to start exploring more of the city. Weather The weather has been beautiful. In the morning it\x26rsquo;s usually around 70 degrees and clear. From around 11 to 4 it gets very hot, and then it often rains in the late afternoon and evening. As I\x26rsquo;m writing this, I\x26rsquo;m just getting dried off, because even though an umbrella was the first thing I bought here, I never have the sense to bring my umbrella when I go out in the morning. Getting connected Since I don\x26rsquo;t have mobile data or a phone plan, I\x26rsquo;ve been completely relient on wifi to stay connected. So far it\x26rsquo;s proven pretty simple. The wifi at the hostel is good. The library also has wifi, although it\x26rsquo;s not quite as reliable. Regardless, I haven\x26rsquo;t run into any issues with needing internet and not being able to get it. I have three different mapping applications on my phone, and all three have the ability to download maps for offline use, which is killer. Batu Caves This morning I packed up a bag and hopped on the KTM Komuter red line heading north for Batu Caves. The caves are sunken into a giant limestone hill, and they\x26rsquo;re marked by the statue of the Hindu Lord Murugan: It\x26#39;s the tallest statue in Malaysia and the second tallest statue of a Hindu deity in the world. There\x26rsquo;s one main cave, two slightly lesser ones, and many smaller caves. They\x26rsquo;re filled with various shrines and smaller statues. To get to the main cave you have to climb up a steep flight of stairs (pictured above behind Murugan). Inside the main cave there\x26rsquo;s a series of three large caverns, each with a shrine. The second cavern has a small crevice in the roof where light peeps through, and the third has a huge opening through which the sky lights the cave. There\x26rsquo;s also water seeping through the openings, dripping on unsuspecting heads at various points throughout the cave. There are also a few hens and pigeons scampering about. Here are the stairs leading up to the third cavern in the main cave: Inside the main cave. Along the walkway outside the caves, there are lots of temples and galleries, lots of pigeons and monkeys, and lots of restaurants. I had lunch at a small Indian café, which seemed to insist on Coca-Cola with every dish, so I had a Coke. Outside there was a blue-and-gold macaw and a sulphur-crested cockatoo perched on a branch. They clearly weren\x26rsquo;t wild, but they weren\x26rsquo;t exactly pets, and it struck me how colorful and shiny their feathers were. The full Batu Caves photo album is here.]",

    "content": "[I landed in Kuala Lumpur on Friday afternoon. The flights were excellent; Asian airlines always seem to me much nicer than American ones. From the airport I took a 30 minute train ride into KL\x26rsquo;s Old City Centre district, and struggled for a couple hours to find my hostel in the rain. Once I did, I had to quickly figure out how to get cash, where to find food and an umbrella, and how to use my voltage converter to charge my phone. It was a rough first night, and I wasn\x26rsquo;t as prepared as I should\x26rsquo;ve been. First impressions die hard (or something); everyday since has been great. The next day I woke up early to clear skies and had a delicious breakfast and tea at the hostel. I started exploring by foot and found that the traffic and sidewalks are much more manageable in the mornings. I found the beautiful Dataran Merdeka (Independence Square), where Malaysian independence from Britain was declared in 1957. It\x26rsquo;s surrounded by lots of really neat old colonial buildings. I also found a public library where I\x26rsquo;ve been spending some time the last few days. I ventured to the west side of the district, and found Taman Tasik Perdana (Lake Gardens), a giant park which contains—among other things—the National Planetarium and the KL Bird Park. Kuala Lumpur has a bird park! There\x26rsquo;s an entrance fee, so I came back a couple days later prepared to spend a whole morning there. Here are some pictures I took: A playful red lorikeet in the World of Parrots area. \x26#34;Hey Frank, didja hear the one about the deaf cockatoo? Neither did he. \/(^o^)\/\x26#34; The hornbills were one the most interesting birds there. I\x26#39;d never seen one before. Right after I took the picture above, a couple people approached me and asked if I\x26rsquo;d be interested in doing an interview. They were filming some sort of Malaysia PSA, as best as I can tell. They were incredibly nice, and asked a lot about where I was from and what I thought about Kuala Lumpur. This grey whistled with me for a bit. The full album of photos I took at KL Bird Park is here. I haven\x26rsquo;t ventured too far outside the Old City Centre yet. There\x26rsquo;s so much to see on every block that there\x26rsquo;s no need to! Some more pictures are here. Other things of note: Traffic is crazy. I don\x26rsquo;t remember it being like this in Phnom Penh. Trying to cross the street is terrifying (even at a crosswalk). The markets and the food are amazing. Just as cool (and cheap!) as they\x26rsquo;re reputed to be. And I haven\x26rsquo;t even been to any night markets yet, which KL is known for. I wasn\x26rsquo;t sure what to expect from my first time staying in a hostel. My room is tiny and windowless, the showers are cold, and the building is more than a bit rundown. But the proprieters and other guests have all been quite nice, there\x26rsquo;s free breakfast and coffee and tea, the building is air conditioned, it\x26rsquo;s centrally located, and it feels safe and secure. And regardless, the price of hostels here is incredibly low for what you get, so I\x26rsquo;m very happy so far. Do yourself a favor and don\x26rsquo;t look at this or this if you have things to do.]",

Somewhere in there I also watch a Shia LeBeouf video. Earlier this month I spent a week in Washington, DC at a conference for work. I got a chance to see the touristy stuff on Tuesday, so for the weekend I walked around and saw neighborhoods and ate food. It was my first time in DC and I really, really liked it, especially once I got out of downtown. The Georgetown and Dupont Circle neighborhoods were particularly cool. We\x26rsquo;ve had a mouse in our office at work for awhile, and the customer support team area has recently become a hub for shared snacks. This pleases the mouse. My coworker jbeane88 kajiggered together a live trap, and - after a couple days of refinements - managed to catch the mouse. He released it at a nearby park and had the good sense to catch the high octane release on video: Liveleak, here we come. Last night I went to the 331 Club to see a couple bands, and a very intoxicated woman from the army hit on me for 20 minutes and pinched my butt. It was a nice confidence boost. Last month I spent a few days in lovely Winona, MN with my friend Corey, and we found a keyboard waiting to be picked up with the trash, so we took it. Unfortunately it doesn\x26rsquo;t seem to work.

    "content": "[Remember these? The John Mayer one is great. I wish these would be popular again. There\x26rsquo;s a new Modest Mouse album! Strangers to Ourselves is their first full release in 7 years. It\x26rsquo;s cool and worth checking out if you like them. Listening for the month or so that it\x26rsquo;s been out has given me occasion to reflect on the strangely interwoven role that Modest Mouse has played in my dating life. At some point in 2009 I had a conversation on a friend\x26rsquo;s Facebook status with a cute girl on a topic I can\x26rsquo;t recall. Whatever the conversation was about, it was sufficiently interesting, so we moved to private messages. Perusing her profile, it was pretty clear she was a fan of a band called Modest Mouse. I\x26rsquo;d heard Float On but was otherwise generally unaware of them. I remember seeing her last.fm page and noting that the song Heart Cooks Brain had a lot more plays than anything else (the next four songs were MGMT, I think). We messaged back and forth for awhile, and at some point I picked up a MM album from Best Buy. To not-so-subtly show my desperation interest, I put some lyrics from Float On in the little text area that used to be underneath profile pictures on Facebook. She was into it; we decided to get ice cream and see a movie. (I think it might\x26rsquo;ve been the Star Trek that came out that year. Chris Pine\x26hellip; *swoon*.) My main memory of the date was showing up at Dairy Queen. I walked in, and was mildly annoyed at the large youth baseball team that was there. Being the only two people over 5\x26rsquo; there, I saw her over the top of the kids\x26rsquo; heads near the opposite entrance. I started making my way through the crowd, continually excusing myself as I bumped into people. Now, the building is only about 15 feet across, but there were a lot of children between us. I was looking in her direction as I made my way over, half-smiling and ready to say hello. I could tell that she had seen me in the corner of her eye, but was pretending not to notice me navigating the labyrinth of humans. When I got to her, she finally acknowledged my presence and we exchanged hellos. For the next 15 minutes, we stood silently in line, jammed much too close together because of the packed building. It was an awkward start, to say the least. I don\x26rsquo;t remember much about the rest of the date, other than the fact that it didn\x26rsquo;t really improve. A couple years later, I\x26rsquo;d started listening to more Modest Mouse, and had come to genuinely like them. On Wikipedia, I noticed that a certain guitarist called Johnny Mar had been in the band for a stint. I\x26rsquo;d first heard of Mr. Marr and The Smiths a number of years earlier, on a Third Eye Blind fan forum that I spent an embarrassing amount of time on. A line from The Smiths\x26rsquo; song There is a Light that Never Goes Out was in somebody\x26rsquo;s signature on the forum. I had taken a short dive into The Smiths, and took a liking to them. But it wasn\x26rsquo;t until years later - scanning the Modest Mouse Wikipedia page - that I ran into Johnny Marr\x26rsquo;s name again, and really dug into The Smiths\x26rsquo; catalog. This happened to coincide with my second profile (of three, so far) that I had on the dating site OkCupid. In the \x26ldquo;favorite music\x26rdquo; section on my profile, I\x26rsquo;d decided it\x26rsquo;d be a good idea to list The Smiths, since I was interested in dating other generally mopey and joyless people. Within a couple days of this addition, I received the message \x26ldquo;the smiths fucking suck.\x26rdquo; Surprisingly, this turned into a fun conversation about English bands and, eventually, plans for a coffee date. The day of the date, I showed up a few minutes early, and got a table before she was there. I waited about 45 minutes before I concluded she wasn\x26rsquo;t coming. She must\x26rsquo;ve really hated The Smiths. Another couple years later, on the fourth of July, I\x26rsquo;d decided to take a relaxing walk along the Mississippi River and watch fireworks wherever I ended up seeing them. By some cosmic dictation, I was listening to Modest Mouse - I\x26rsquo;d made it through Building Nothing Out of Something and was two songs into Good News For People Who Love Bad News. Walking through a park where people had gathered to watch the show, I saw someone waving at me; it was my ex-girlfriend. She\x26rsquo;d also come to relax and watch the fireworks, so we decided to hang out and catch up. Thus kicked off a brief and forced re-romance that fizzled pretty shortly thereafter. Damn you, Isaac Brock. Despite the seeming curse they have on my dating life, I can\x26rsquo;t help but love Isaac Brock and gang. I\x26rsquo;m still trying to decide if I want to shell out the money to see them at Rock the Garden next month. The new album is more of the same, which is fine by me. If you like their old stuff there\x26rsquo;s no reason you won\x26rsquo;t like Strangers to Ourselves. In other news, my devout readers may have noticed the new site design. Certain co-workers who will go unnamed ragged on me for my 1998-inspired design. I liked it but I admit it was a little old-timey and unintuitive. So I bumped it forward about 5 years. I like this one more.]",
