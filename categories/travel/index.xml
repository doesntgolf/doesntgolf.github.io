      <title>A Month in Chiang Mai</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If heaven is a place on earth, it&amp;rsquo;s Chiang Mai, Thailand. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent the month of February not really doing much. Chiang Mai is well suited to leisurely lounging around town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chiang Mai is situated in a valley, so the climate is more pleasant than a lot of the region. The surrounding bluffs make for a lot of great hiking. I made the trip west of town to Doi Suthep national park four times, in search of hiking and birds. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to spot any weird birds but the waterfalls and hiking were good.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;In the center of the city is a walled area surrounded by a moat, 1.6 km on each side. Inside the walled &amp;ldquo;old city&amp;rdquo; are lots of temples and stores and cafes. My guesthouse was situated a couple blocks south of the southern gate to the old city. There&amp;rsquo;s a fresh food market at the gate, and tons of street food stalls in the evenings, so I ate most of my meals there, seated next to the moat. I ate mostly sushi and smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Almost every street in Chiang Mai is lined with little shops and cafes and bars. In the evenings there&amp;rsquo;s live music coming from everywhere, and on the weekends there are &amp;ldquo;walking markets&amp;rdquo; in a couple locations, usually crowded beyond belief. There also seem to be music stores and instrument shops all over town.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm2.staticflickr.com/1605/24494317643_165f797e57_c.jpg&#34; /&gt;
    
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I got breakfast and lunch at a coffee shop near the guesthouse a bunch because it was cheap and the lady that worked there gave me the scoop about all the places I need to visit. Usually I was the only person there but the second-to-last time I went there were a couple Americans debating whether &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; was an inside job. &lt;em&gt;Yay America&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full Chiang Mai photo album is available &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133041204@N06/sets/72157663697447279&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tomorrow morning it&amp;rsquo;s onwards and upwards to the island of Penang, Malaysia. I really need to get to bed but I can&amp;rsquo;t stop watching Rick and Morty.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Holiday in Cambodia</title>

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KTsXHXMkJA&#34;&gt;Reference and soundtrack for this post.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Kuala Lumpur for just over a month now. As I alluded to in my last post, lately I&amp;rsquo;ve been taking the free KL city bus around almost everyday, and seeing more of the city. I&amp;rsquo;ve been to Petronas Twin Towers, Menara Kuala Lumpur, back to Lake Gardens, and a bunch of malls like Low Yat (an &amp;ldquo;IT lifestyle mall&amp;rdquo;), KLCC, and Berjaya Times Square. Most of these are in the Golden Triangle and Bukit Bintang areas, a couple miles east of my hostel.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5781/23492187489_4788811c33_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Petronas Twin Towers&#34; /&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Last week I went to the US Embassy to get some extra passport pages, which is a service that is apparently ceasing after January 1st. It felt like a DMV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been catching up on podcasts that I fell behind on, mostly while walking around the malls and riding the bus. I also saw the new James Bond movie the other day, and I&amp;rsquo;ll probably see Star Wars soon, like the obedient consumer that I am. OH! and I just found out there&amp;rsquo;s a new Charlie Kaufman movie called Anomalisa that opens next month. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure if I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to see it in Malaysia but I&amp;rsquo;ll be keeping an eye out.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Christmas in Malaysia—it turns out—is serious business. Everywhere I turn, including in my hostel lounge, there are brightly adorned Christmas trees and smiling Santas and plastic snowmen. Especially in the Golden Triangle (aka the Central Business District), it feels very much like the wonderfully commercial sales-month that I&amp;rsquo;m used to in the US. (There&amp;rsquo;s nothing like a good deal on TVs to make me feel all warm and fuzzy.) This despite the fact that &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christianity_in_Malaysia&#34;&gt;only 9.2% of Malaysians are Christian&lt;/a&gt;. It &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a public holiday here, but apparently it&amp;rsquo;s only celebrated on Christmas Eve, and then it&amp;rsquo;s business-as-usual on the 25th.&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;resolutions:23ac1a3c3444fb682e0a8476884c6aee&#34;&gt;Resolutions&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions are silly. Here are mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Write&lt;/strong&gt; I want to get better at writing. About techy stuff, thinky stuff, and bloggy stuff. At the moment I have 7 half-written blog posts in my drafts folder about tech/web/software, so part one of my resolution is to commit to finishing these posts and writing more in general. Also related to writing better, I need to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; Not that reading isn&amp;rsquo;t an end unto itself, but I want to read both for the sake of reading and of writing better. I&amp;rsquo;ve already been reading a lot more since arriving in Kuala Lumpur so part two of my resolution is to keep it up, and maybe even kick it up a gear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meditate&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to start meditating more times than I can count, and I never stick with it. Part three of my resolution is to stick with it. I want to think more clearly, stay more focused, and be more relaxed. I&amp;rsquo;m hoping meditation can be a step in that direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s inevitably a lot more that I&amp;rsquo;m not including, but I think focusing on these three things will help me with all the other ones. Like all good New Year&amp;rsquo;s resolutions, it inevitably contains too much anyway, and is sure to collapse unto itself. Maybe I should just get a gym membership. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Happy Festivus!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Adjusting and Batu Caves</title>
      <link>https://natedobbins.net/travel/adjusting-and-batu-caves.html</link>

      <description>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been in Kuala Lumpur for just under two weeks now, and I&amp;rsquo;m settling into a pretty comfortable routine. I usually divide my day into three parts: in one part I explore a new part of the city, in another I head to the library to code or read, and in the last I relax. In between I find some food. I switch up the arrangement of the parts each day. Just having a routine is nice, though, and it&amp;rsquo;s helping me adjust pretty well. In no particular order, here are some thoughts on adapting to various aspects of life in Malaysia.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;language:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Language&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Getting down the basics of Bahasa Malay has been straightforward. Word order is subject-verb-object like English. It also borrows a lot of words from English (this is where Malay branches apart from Indonesian, which is closely related but borrows from Dutch). The writing system is &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; phonetic, which is almost jarring coming from English. Most words are pronounced exactly how you&amp;rsquo;d guess when reading them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only problem is that almost everyone here speaks English (and I&amp;rsquo;m so white), so everyone defaults to English. That&amp;rsquo;s probably a good thing though, because I&amp;rsquo;d be lost beyond the basics. My aunt was right, though, when she said that most people would probably be thankful when I put a small effort into using Malay. Usually I just slip in a &lt;em&gt;terima kasih&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;selamat pagi&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;food:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Food&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can&amp;rsquo;t be overstated how good the food is. And the food stalls and cafés are neverending! Just walking down random streets, I&amp;rsquo;ll often unintentionally wander into big street markets lined with the most wonderful-smelling food I could imagine. I&amp;rsquo;m glad I have another couple months in KL, because I&amp;rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-around:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Getting around&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the train to get from the airport to the city center, and to get to Batu Caves (more on that below). Other than that, I&amp;rsquo;ve just walked everywhere. Getting around on foot is pretty easy, but there are some areas where sidewalks are a little weird. Sometimes they&amp;rsquo;ll just end, or they&amp;rsquo;ll merge into the road. For awhile I would get confused and not know how to keep going in the general direction I was trying to go, until I realized that people would just walk on the road. This happens even on bigger roads where traffic is flying by, so it took me a bit to get used to, but now I&amp;rsquo;m on board. It&amp;rsquo;s evened out by the fact that drivers often park partially on the sidewalk, and motorcyclists (who are numerous!) often &lt;em&gt;drive&lt;/em&gt; on the sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve explored just about everywhere within a three kilometer radius of my hostel, so over the next couple weeks I&amp;rsquo;m going to start using the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.gokl.com.my/&#34;&gt;Go-KL&lt;/a&gt; city bus (because it&amp;rsquo;s free!) to start exploring more of the city.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;weather:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Weather&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weather has been beautiful. In the morning it&amp;rsquo;s usually around 70 degrees and clear. From around 11 to 4 it gets very hot, and then it often rains in the late afternoon and evening. As I&amp;rsquo;m writing this, I&amp;rsquo;m just getting dried off, because even though an umbrella was the first thing I bought here, I never have the sense to bring my umbrella when I go out in the morning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;getting-connected:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Getting connected&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I don&amp;rsquo;t have mobile data or a phone plan, I&amp;rsquo;ve been completely relient on wifi to stay connected. So far it&amp;rsquo;s proven pretty simple. The wifi at the hostel is good. The library also has wifi, although it&amp;rsquo;s not quite as reliable. Regardless, I haven&amp;rsquo;t run into any issues with needing internet and not being able to get it. I have three different mapping applications on my phone, and all three have the ability to download maps for offline use, which is killer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;batu-caves:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3&#34;&gt;Batu Caves&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This morning I packed up a bag and hopped on the KTM Komuter red line heading north for Batu Caves. The caves are sunken into a giant limestone hill, and they&amp;rsquo;re marked by the statue of the Hindu Lord Murugan:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm6.staticflickr.com/5777/23418089165_bc7f5bf939_c.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;It&amp;#39;s the tallest statue in Malaysia and the second tallest statue of a Hindu deity in the world.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
        It&amp;#39;s the tallest statue in Malaysia and the second tallest statue of a Hindu deity in the world.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s one main cave, two slightly lesser ones, and many smaller caves. They&amp;rsquo;re filled with various shrines and smaller statues. To get to the main cave you have to climb up a steep flight of stairs (pictured above behind Murugan). Inside the main cave there&amp;rsquo;s a series of three large caverns, each with a shrine. The second cavern has a small crevice in the roof where light peeps through, and the third has a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; opening through which the sky lights the cave. There&amp;rsquo;s also water seeping through the openings, dripping on unsuspecting heads at various points throughout the cave. There are also a few hens and pigeons scampering about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here are the stairs leading up to the third cavern in the main cave:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;
    
        &lt;img src=&#34;https://farm1.staticflickr.com/739/23122380170_23d3eeb083_z.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Inside the main cave.&#34; /&gt;
    
    
    &lt;figcaption&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Along the walkway outside the caves, there are lots of temples and galleries, lots of pigeons and monkeys, and lots of restaurants. I had lunch at a small Indian café, which seemed to insist on Coca-Cola with every dish, so I had a Coke. Outside there was a blue-and-gold macaw and a sulphur-crested cockatoo perched on a branch. They clearly weren&amp;rsquo;t wild, but they weren&amp;rsquo;t exactly pets, and it struck me how colorful and shiny their feathers were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full Batu Caves photo album is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133041204@N06/albums/72157661786697196&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Arrival and KL Bird Park</title>
      <link>https://natedobbins.net/travel/arrival-and-kl-bird-park.html</link>
      
      <pubDate>Tue, 24 Nov 2015</pubDate>

      <guid>https://natedobbins.net/travel/arrival-and-kl-bird-park.html</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I landed in Kuala Lumpur on Friday afternoon. The flights were excellent; Asian airlines always seem to me much nicer than American ones. From the airport I took a 30 minute train ride into KL&amp;rsquo;s Old City Centre district, and struggled for a couple hours to find my hostel in the rain. Once I did, I had to quickly figure out how to get cash, where to find food and an umbrella, and how to use my voltage converter to charge my phone. It was a rough first night, and I wasn&amp;rsquo;t as prepared as I should&amp;rsquo;ve been.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First impressions die hard (or something); everyday since has been great. The next day I woke up early to clear skies and had a delicious breakfast and tea at the hostel. I started exploring by foot and found that the traffic and sidewalks are much more manageable in the mornings. I found the beautiful &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merdeka_Square,_Kuala_Lumpur&#34;&gt;Dataran Merdeka&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Independence Square), where Malaysian independence from Britain was declared in 1957. It&amp;rsquo;s surrounded by lots of really neat old colonial buildings. I also found a public library where I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending some time the last few days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ventured to the west side of the district, and found &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lake_Gardens,_Kuala_Lumpur&#34;&gt;Taman Tasik Perdana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Lake Gardens), a giant park which contains—among other things—the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133041204@N06/22793572549/in/album-72157660736018089/lightbox/&#34;&gt;National Planetarium&lt;/a&gt; and the KL Bird Park. &lt;strong&gt;Kuala Lumpur has a &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.klbirdpark.com/&#34;&gt;bird park&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/strong&gt; There&amp;rsquo;s an entrance fee, so I came back a couple days later prepared to spend a whole morning there. Here are some pictures I took:&lt;/p&gt;


&lt;figure &gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;



&lt;figure &gt;

        The hornbills were one the most interesting birds there. I&amp;#39;d never seen one before.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Right after I took the picture above, a couple people approached me and asked if I&amp;rsquo;d be interested in doing an interview. They were filming some sort of Malaysia PSA, as best as I can tell. They were incredibly nice, and asked a lot about where I was from and what I thought about Kuala Lumpur.&lt;/p&gt;

        This grey whistled with me for a bit.
        
            
        
        &lt;/p&gt; 
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
    
&lt;/figure&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The full album of photos I took at KL Bird Park is &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133041204@N06/albums/72157661467887295&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven&amp;rsquo;t ventured too far outside the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikivoyage.org/wiki/Kuala_Lumpur/Central&#34;&gt;Old City Centre&lt;/a&gt; yet. There&amp;rsquo;s so much to see on every block that there&amp;rsquo;s no need to! Some more pictures are &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/133041204@N06/albums/72157660736018089&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other things of note:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Traffic is crazy. I don&amp;rsquo;t remember it being like this in Phnom Penh. Trying to cross the street is terrifying (even at a crosswalk).&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;The markets and the food are amazing. Just as cool (and cheap!) as they&amp;rsquo;re reputed to be. And I haven&amp;rsquo;t even been to any night markets yet, which KL is known for.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;I wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to expect from my first time staying in a hostel. My room is tiny and windowless, the showers are cold, and the building is more than a bit rundown. But the proprieters and other guests have all been quite nice, there&amp;rsquo;s free breakfast and coffee and tea, the building is air conditioned, it&amp;rsquo;s centrally located, and it feels safe and secure. And regardless, the price of hostels here is incredibly low for what you get, so I&amp;rsquo;m very happy so far.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;Do yourself a favor and don&amp;rsquo;t look at &lt;a href=&#34;http://fahrinfo.vbb.de/bin/help.exe/dn?L=vs_mobilitymap&amp;amp;tpl=fullmap&amp;amp;tabApp=show&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://brunoimbrizi.com/experiments/#/07&#34;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; if you have things to do.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m vacating the country till this election thing blows over. The best way to reach me is at &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:hello@natedobbins.net&#34;&gt;hello@natedobbins.net&lt;/a&gt;, but any of my old email addresses and phone number still work fine. I&amp;rsquo;ll try to do some writing and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s my approximate flight route for funzies:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m unemployed. It&amp;rsquo;s scary but feels like a good decision so far. I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to spend the last couple weeks relaxing, focusing on cross country &amp;amp; birds, and hanging out with my family. I could get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
