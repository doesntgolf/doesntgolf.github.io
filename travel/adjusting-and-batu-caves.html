<p>I&rsquo;ve been in Kuala Lumpur for just under two weeks now, and I&rsquo;m settling into a pretty comfortable routine. I usually divide my day into three parts: in one part I explore a new part of the city, in another I head to the library to code or read, and in the last I relax. In between I find some food. I switch up the arrangement of the parts each day. Just having a routine is nice, though, and it&rsquo;s helping me adjust pretty well. In no particular order, here are some thoughts on adapting to various aspects of life in Malaysia.</p>

<h1 id="language:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Language</h1>

<p>Getting down the basics of Bahasa Malay has been straightforward. Word order is subject-verb-object like English. It also borrows a lot of words from English (this is where Malay branches apart from Indonesian, which is closely related but borrows from Dutch). The writing system is <strong>very</strong> phonetic, which is almost jarring coming from English. Most words are pronounced exactly how you&rsquo;d guess when reading them.</p>

<p>The only problem is that almost everyone here speaks English (and I&rsquo;m so white), so everyone defaults to English. That&rsquo;s probably a good thing though, because I&rsquo;d be lost beyond the basics. My aunt was right, though, when she said that most people would probably be thankful when I put a small effort into using Malay. Usually I just slip in a <em>terima kasih</em> or <em>selamat pagi</em>.</p>

<h1 id="food:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Food</h1>

<p>It can&rsquo;t be overstated how good the food is. And the food stalls and cafés are neverending! Just walking down random streets, I&rsquo;ll often unintentionally wander into big street markets lined with the most wonderful-smelling food I could imagine. I&rsquo;m glad I have another couple months in KL, because I&rsquo;ve barely scratched the surface yet.</p>

<h1 id="getting-around:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Getting around</h1>

<p>So far, I&rsquo;ve used the train to get from the airport to the city center, and to get to Batu Caves (more on that below). Other than that, I&rsquo;ve just walked everywhere. Getting around on foot is pretty easy, but there are some areas where sidewalks are a little weird. Sometimes they&rsquo;ll just end, or they&rsquo;ll merge into the road. For awhile I would get confused and not know how to keep going in the general direction I was trying to go, until I realized that people would just walk on the road. This happens even on bigger roads where traffic is flying by, so it took me a bit to get used to, but now I&rsquo;m on board. It&rsquo;s evened out by the fact that drivers often park partially on the sidewalk, and motorcyclists (who are numerous!) often <em>drive</em> on the sidewalks.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve explored just about everywhere within a three kilometer radius of my hostel, so over the next couple weeks I&rsquo;m going to start using the <a href="http://www.gokl.com.my/">Go-KL</a> city bus (because it&rsquo;s free!) to start exploring more of the city.</p>

<h1 id="weather:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Weather</h1>

<p>The weather has been beautiful. In the morning it&rsquo;s usually around 70 degrees and clear. From around 11 to 4 it gets very hot, and then it often rains in the late afternoon and evening. As I&rsquo;m writing this, I&rsquo;m just getting dried off, because even though an umbrella was the first thing I bought here, I never have the sense to bring my umbrella when I go out in the morning.</p>

<h1 id="getting-connected:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Getting connected</h1>

<p>Since I don&rsquo;t have mobile data or a phone plan, I&rsquo;ve been completely relient on wifi to stay connected. So far it&rsquo;s proven pretty simple. The wifi at the hostel is good. The library also has wifi, although it&rsquo;s not quite as reliable. Regardless, I haven&rsquo;t run into any issues with needing internet and not being able to get it. I have three different mapping applications on my phone, and all three have the ability to download maps for offline use, which is killer.</p>

<h1 id="batu-caves:8b21b83e3eb70520743ff76bb4cc09d3">Batu Caves</h1>

<p>This morning I packed up a bag and hopped on the KTM Komuter red line heading north for Batu Caves. The caves are sunken into a giant limestone hill, and they&rsquo;re marked by the statue of the Hindu Lord Murugan:</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s one main cave, two slightly lesser ones, and many smaller caves. They&rsquo;re filled with various shrines and smaller statues. To get to the main cave you have to climb up a steep flight of stairs (pictured above behind Murugan). Inside the main cave there&rsquo;s a series of three large caverns, each with a shrine. The second cavern has a small crevice in the roof where light peeps through, and the third has a <em>huge</em> opening through which the sky lights the cave. There&rsquo;s also water seeping through the openings, dripping on unsuspecting heads at various points throughout the cave. There are also a few hens and pigeons scampering about.</p>

<p>Here are the stairs leading up to the third cavern in the main cave:</p>

<p>Along the walkway outside the caves, there are lots of temples and galleries, lots of pigeons and monkeys, and lots of restaurants. I had lunch at a small Indian café, which seemed to insist on Coca-Cola with every dish, so I had a Coke. Outside there was a blue-and-gold macaw and a sulphur-crested cockatoo perched on a branch. They clearly weren&rsquo;t wild, but they weren&rsquo;t exactly pets, and it struck me how colorful and shiny their feathers were.</p>
